        This hearty, flavourful dish is easy to customize and great for leftovers.<br>
        It is quite literally my favorite dish of all time.

<h2>Let. Them. Cook!</h2>
<div class="directions">
    <ol>
        <li>Dice the onions and add them to a pot with 1/8 C Oil. Caramelize them over just-above medium heat,
            stirring occasionaly, until they are a deep chocolate color. This is the longest step and may take 1-2 hours,
            but it makes or breaks the dish!</li>
        <li>While the onions are caramelizing, slice up your okra and add to a pan with a few tablespoons of oil.
            Heat them over medium heat, stirring occasionaly, until the slime is cooked out.</li>
        <li>While both of those steps are cooking, slice the green onions and mince the 4 cloves of garlic. You should also prep your broth, water, and bay leaves.</li>
        <li>When the onions are done caramelizing, add the green onions, okra, garlic, and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> tsp of cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir for about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the broth, water, and bay leaves to the pot. Stir well to ensure none of the ingredients are stuck to the bottom.</li>
        <li>Add a few shakes of cajun seasoning and a few tablespoons of red hot.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, then let simmer with the lid on for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>While the gumbo simmers, cook the sausage in a pan and hydrate the soy curls.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>To hydrate the soy curls, put them in a bowl with warm water and let sit for 10 minutes. Then drain the water and set them aside.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>After the gumbo has simmered for an hour, add the sausage, soy curls, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tsp salt,
            and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> tsp pepper. Simmer for 30 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Add equal parts 3 C dry rice and water to an instant pot. Set the instant pot to high pressure for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 30 minutes, serve over rice and top with more cajun seasoning and red hot until you find your perfect balance!</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
